============

From PyPi
---------

The easierst way to install saenopy is using pip

    ``pip install saenopy``

From the repository
-------------------

.. _Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/fabry_biophysics/saeno/get/tip.zip

If you want to have the development version, either download a static version from Bitbucket_ or
clone the repository.

    ``hg clone https://bitbucket.org/fabry_biophysics/saenopy``

To install the downloaded/cloned package, open the folder an execute in a command line:

    ``pip install -e .``

which will register the current folder as your saenopy source. If you omit the '-e' the content of the folder
is copied to your python path and you then do not need to keep the folder.
